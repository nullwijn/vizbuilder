### Creates visualizations for you
This package aims to simplify ggplot2/plotly and shiny to be approachable for the common user. The purpose is to help interface between ggplot2 on backend and simple inputs with shiny on the front end. The user can use either scatterplot() or linegraph() on any data frame to be greeted with an interface to help create basic visuals.
